# Regression Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various regression algorithms from scratch. Each algorithm is designed to offer a comprehensive understanding of regression techniques and their practical applications. The following algorithms are included:

- **Linear Regression**: A fundamental algorithm for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear approach.

- **Polynomial Regression**: An extension of linear regression that fits a polynomial function to the data for capturing non-linear relationships.

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Regression**: Also known as Support Vector Regression (SVR), this method finds a hyperplane that best fits the data while maintaining a margin of tolerance.
