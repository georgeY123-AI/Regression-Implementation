# Regression Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various regression algorithms from scratch. Each algorithm is designed to offer a comprehensive understanding of regression techniques and their practical applications. The following algorithms are included:

- **Linear Regression**: A fundamental algorithm for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear approach.
- **Polynomial Regression**: An extension of linear regression that fits a polynomial function to the data for capturing non-linear relationships.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Regression**: Also known as Support Vector Regression (SVR), this method finds a hyperplane that best fits the data while maintaining a margin of tolerance.
- **Neural Networks (NN) for Regression**: Implements a basic neural network tailored for regression tasks, showcasing the core principles of deep learning in predicting continuous values.
- **Decision Tree for Regression**: A tree-based model that splits the data into branches to make predictions based on feature values, used for capturing non-linear relationships.
- **Random Forest for Regression**: An ensemble method that aggregates multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness.
- **Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) for Regression**: An advanced ensemble technique that builds trees sequentially to correct errors and improve regression performance.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for Regression**: A non-parametric algorithm that predicts values based on the average of the nearest neighbors' outputs.

Each implementation provides insight into the mechanics of the algorithm, along with theoretical explanations and practical code examples. This repository aims to be a valuable resource for understanding and applying these regression techniques.
